  <h1>Let's play Rock - Paper - scissors</h1>
  <h3>This are the rules: Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper. If both players throw the same hand signal, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until there is a clear winner.</h3>
  
  <h2>Let's play! Choose your weapon!</h2>
